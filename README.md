# Pong game
## Description
- The ball spawns in the middle of the canvas with either an upward left or an upward right velocity. No credit if the ball moves only horizontally left or right. Bleh, that would be boring!

 - The ball bounces off of the top and bottom walls correctly. (1 pt each)

- The ball respawns in the middle of the screen when it strikes the left or right gutter but not the paddles. (1 pt for each side) Give credit for this item even if the ball hits the edge of the canvas instead of the gutter.

- The left and right gutters (instead of the edges of the canvas) are properly used as the edges of the table.

- The ball spawns moving towards the player that won the last point.

- The 'w' and 's' keys correctly control the velocity of the left paddle as described above. Please test each key in isolation. (1 pt if the paddle moves, but in an incorrect manner in response to 'w' and 's' key presses.)

- The up and down arrows keys correctly control the velocity of the right paddle as described above. Please test each key in isolation. (1 pt if the paddle moves, but in an incorrect manner in response to up and down arrow key presses.)
- The edge of each paddle is flush with the gutter.
- The paddles stay on the canvas at all times. 

- The ball correctly bounces off the left and right paddles. 
- The scoring text is positioned and updated appropriately. The positioning need only approximate that in the video.

- The game includes a "Restart" button that resets the score and relaunches the ball.
